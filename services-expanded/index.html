      <h2 id="services">Comprehensive Eye Exam</h2>
      <p class="service-description">A comprehensive eye exam offers us a complete picture of your eye health. Certain eye
      diseases and conditions can develop without presenting symptoms, so it’s essential to
      schedule routine eye exams to prevent future vision problems.
      Our comprehensive eye exams allow us to dive deep into your overall visual health. We
      can detect new or ongoing eye conditions using our advanced equipment and provide
      customized treatment that suits your lifestyle. As associates of Coastal Eye Associates,
      we work closely with ophthalmology subspecialists and will work with you to schedule
      any necessary referrals.</p>

      <h3>Cataracts</h3>
      <p class="service-description">Almost everyone develops cataracts since its primary cause is inevitable: aging.
      Symptoms of cataracts include blurred or foggy vision, light sensitivity, and seeing halos
      around lights.</p>
      <p class="service-description">Cataracts form within the lens, which is responsible for focusing light that enters the iris.
      As we age, the lens becomes more rigid, and tissues harden and form clumps, causing
      opaque spots.</p>
      <p class="service-description">If you are concerned you may have cataracts, schedule a comprehensive exam to allow
      us to evaluate your lens and determine if cataract surgery is indicated. If so, we will
      work with you to recommend a cataract surgeon you are comfortable with as well as
      discuss surgical options to consider prior to seeing the surgeon.</p>

      <h3>Glaucoma</h3>
      <p class="service-description">Glaucoma is an eye condition that affects the optic nerve. It causes high pressure in
      your eye and can progress without showing symptoms.</p>
      <p class="service-description">As one of the leading cause of blindness in people over 60, glaucoma testing can
      potentially save your eyesight. An eye exam is the only way to detect glaucoma before it
      progresses into vision loss that can’t be repaired.</p>
      <p class="service-description">Glaucoma screening is done on all patients during a comprehensive eye exam.
      Glaucoma treatment often starts with eye drops but if surgery is indicated, we will work
      with you to schedule a follow-up appointment with a glaucoma sub-specialist.</p>

      <h3>Diabetic Retinopathy</h3>
      <p class="service-description">Diabetic Retinopathy is an eye condition that can develop among patients with diabetes
      (type 1 and type 2). When the bloodstream has elevated glucose levels, the blood
      vessels in the eyes can swell and leak into the retina.</p>
      <p class="service-description">There are 4 stages of diabetic retinopathy that increase in severity as the condition
      progresses. A diabetic eye exam is recommended for patients with diabetes to test for
      diabetic retinopathy, so we can detect it in its early stages before it progresses. If
      diabetic retinopathy is detected, we will work closely with your primary care physician to
      be certain you have necessary follow-up care as well as recommending a retina
      specialist who can provide any necessary treatment.</p>

      <h3>Macular Degeneration</h3>
      <p class="service-description">Age-Related Macular Degeneration(AMD) affects the macula, a tiny but crucial part of
      the eye in the center of the retina. Early symptoms often don’t appear, but later,
      symptoms of AMD can blur your central vision, making it harder to see details.</p>
      <p class="service-description">The two primary types of age-related macular degeneration have different causes:</p>
          <ul class="service-description">
            <li><b>Dry.</b> This type is the most common. About 80% of those with AMD have the dry
      form. Its exact cause is unknown, although both genetic and environmental
      factors are thought to play a role. This happens as the light-sensitive cells in the
      macula slowly break down, generally one eye at a time. The loss of vision in this
      condition is usually slow and gradual.</li>
            <li><b>Wet.</b> Though this type is less common, it usually leads to more severe vision
      loss in patients than dry AMD. It is the most common cause of severe loss of
      vision. Wet AMD happens when abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath
      the retina. They leak fluid and blood — hence the name wet AMD — and can
      create a large blind spot in the center of the visual field.</li>
          </ul>
        <p class="service-description">If your eyes show signs of AMD, we will keep close track of how it
      progresses. Scientists continue to study AMD and new treatments have become
      available for both the wet and dry forms of the condition. South Shore Eye Center
      works closely with retina specialists who treat macular degeneration and we will work
      closely with you to provide you with a referral to a sub-specialist is treatment becomes
      necessary.</p>
